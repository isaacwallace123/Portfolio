# Frontend Architecture

## Overview
The frontend is built with **React + Vite** and styled using **TailwindCSS**.  
Animations and transitions are implemented via **Framer Motion** to deliver smooth and dynamic visuals.

## Structure
- `/components` — Reusable UI and animation components
- `/pages` — Route-based views
- `/shared` — Data and configuration shared across the app

## Design Goals
- Accessibility and responsive design
- Strong animation hierarchy
- Developer experience optimized with Vite's fast refresh
